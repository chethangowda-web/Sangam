## What Sangam is

An open-source Digital Public Good that turns multilingual citizen voice into
evidence-backed infrastructure investment priorities — designed to run in any
country, not just one.

Built for the Google Cloud "Build with AI: Code for Communities" hackathon,
Track 1 — AI for Digital Public Infrastructure & Governance (BRICS / Innovation).

**The core claim — "the join":** citizen feedback and public expenditure records
live in separate systems and are never put side by side. Sangam joins them, which
surfaces two findings no complaint tracker can produce:

- **Unserved gap** — real demand, no money allocated
- **Stalled allocation** — money already sanctioned, citizens still reporting the problem

| 17 | Phase 2: production hardening — added 25 Aug 2026 |

## Load-bearing decisions

1. **`indicators` is tall, not wide** — adding a country ships rows, not migrations.
2. **Weights live in `pack.yaml`, not in code** — the engine computes, the ministry
   sets the political trade-off between equity and reach.
3. **Scoring is model-free** — Gemini writes the explanation, never decides the order.
4. **Generated numbers are programmatically verified** against a closed evidence
   bundle; unverifiable output is rejected, not trusted.
5. **No model call on the dashboard read path** — free-tier rate limits cannot
   break a live demo.

## Key dates

- **16 Aug 2026** — build starts (day 1)
- **24 Aug 2026** — MVP build window ends (original deadline, now superseded)
- **30 Sep 2026** — **actual submission deadline** (extended)
- Shortlist of top 20 teams — TBA
- **October 2026** — in-person finale, New Delhi (exact date TBA)

## Phase 2 — production hardening (added 25 Aug 2026)

The deadline extension is being spent closing three gaps the MVP already
knew about (§1's status note, §17) rather than on unrelated scope:

- **F5** — cross-lingual clustering is currently exact `region + sector`
  match; embeddings already exist on every report but aren't used for
  matching yet. Phase 2 wires them in.
- **F10** — briefing export (`/v1/export/{id}.pdf`) was speced, never built.
- **F11/N5** — "switching country needs zero code" is architecturally true
  but has only ever run with one pack loaded. Phase 2 proves it live with a
  second state pack.

Plus new capabilities: native GPS location sharing + confidence-gated
confirmation (closes the real "Yelahanka" → "Alanka" STT failure found in
live testing — see §16's revisited Risk 2), emerging-hotspot detection,
auth + a policymaker workspace. Gemini moves to a paid tier only in the
final week before testing, to lift the free-tier RPM ceiling — not before,
so nothing through the build depends on a purchase that hasn't happened.
Full detail in §17 of the design doc.

## Stack

Python / FastAPI · Railway (Postgres + pgvector + PostGIS) · Gemini API
(free tier through the build; paid tier from the final week — see Phase 2
above) · React + Leaflet · Railway + Vercel · Apache-2.0
